# Project Proposal
## Background
*Name of the project*
Planning Paper Patterns for Piecers

*Team members and their responsibilities*
Mackenzie Leake -- I am working closely with Abe Davis on this project. I will be working to understand paper piecing more deeply and investigate possible algorithmic tools for producing patterns. Abe will be helping me learn about and explore these patterns from the perspective of computational geometry and determine whether we should pursue a longer-term research project.

## Project Goals
*Description of project and overall goal. What do you want to be able to make?*
I have been interested in pursuing a project related to quilting for some time, and I would like to use the course project to explore one problem in this space. I'd like to explore the advantages and constraints of a quilting technique known as paper piecing (paper piecing is a sewing technique in which you sew fabric directly to paper in a specific order to create quilt blocks). I plan to develop a deeper understanding of this technique by creating a custom paper-pieced quilt and investigating how to create algorithms for constructing and/or verifying valid piecing patterns. Toward the end of the quarter, I will sew a small sample quilt using this technique.

*What is innovative about proposal?*
Paper piecing is a popular tool in the quilting community with many known rules-of-thumb. Although sewing paper pieced quilts from existing patterns is relatively straightforward, designing patterns for this technique is quite challenging. The most difficult parts are dividing an image into shapes that can be sewn easily and producing a valid ordering of fabric pieces. Existing systems to support this kind of pattern are expensive, poorly designed, and not widely used. This quarter we plan to understand this process more rigorously. From our initial exploration on this problem, the geometry of valid patterns must fit certain constraints to guarantee valid orderings of pattern pieces. We would like to understand these constraints more formally and use them to assist in pattern design. I am interested in possibly pursuing this direction as a more long-term research project, so for this quarter I want to focus on getting hands-on experience with the process and developing intuition for the problem by designing and making a custom paper-pieced quilt pattern, which I and other quilters can follow to produce a finished quilt.

*What do you think will be the hardest part of the project?* 
I expect the hardest parts of this project will be 
1) Designing a good paper piecing pattern: I have sewn existing patterns before but never made my own, and from what I have read, pattern design is quite challenging. Going through this process of designing a quilt block and producing a valid ordering manually will help inform my longer-term research interests in this space.
2) Formalizing the constraints on what makes a valid pattern: This could be a complicated computational geometry problem. Once we have a better sense for how complex the geometry is, it should be easier to estimate what kind of computational tools we can create. 

## Project Plans
*Plan and milestones*: 
My primary goal is making a pattern, and then through this process we will learn about the geometric constraints. I will start by designing a single pattern and verifying that it is valid (meaning it can be realized through paper-piecing). We plan to spend the next 2-3 weeks designing this pattern, and then I will spend the last two weeks making a quilt.

*Parts and supplies needed*: 
I plan to purchase a fabric bundle with several different colors for my quilt (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Kaufman-Cotton-Colors-Quarter/dp/B07DCZ4PX6 "this")) so I have some freedom to design some different types of blocks. I already have the thread, batting, and backing fabric as well as the rest of the supplies and equipment I need to sew the quilt.

*References and attributions*: 
Much of my initial understanding of how paper piecing works from a pattern designer's perspective comes from this book: [Adventures in Paper Piecing Design](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Paper-Piecing-Design-Step/dp/1617455571 "Adventures in Paper Piecing Design")
In the research literature there are a few areas of work that will likely be relevant to our project, including research in fabrication, crafting, and computational geometry. Though it tackles a different part of the quilting process, this recent project in the quilting domain is interesting and relevant: [Whole-cloth Quilting Patterns from Photographs](https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2017-autoquilt/ "Whole-cloth Quilting Patterns from Photographs")
